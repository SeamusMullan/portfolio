**Project Brief: Portfolio Website for Seamus Mullan**

Hi there,

I'm Seamus Mullan, a computer science student based in Ireland, currently heading into my third year of study. I'm reaching out to consult on the design and development of a personal portfolio website that represents both the technical and creative facets of my identity. This site will serve as a professional showcase, a creative outlet, and a hub for the projects I build under my personal brand and company, **DirektDSP**.

### About Me

I specialize in real-time audio software, low-level systems, and creative technologies. My main areas of interest include digital signal processing (particularly audio effects plugins), operating systems, game development, and creative coding projects. I’m also a musician and producer, working primarily in FL Studio and Ableton, with a focus on EDM, electronica, and indie rock. While I don’t perform live, I am interested in releasing my music independently and potentially in physical formats.

I'm currently developing an audio plugin under DirektDSP that I plan to finish and monetize by the end of the summer. That plugin, and others like it, should be presented as flagship projects on the site.

### What I'm Looking For

I want my website to reflect both my professional capabilities and my creative versatility. This means:

* A clean, modular design that feels personal but not overly corporate
* A structure that allows me to showcase technical projects (e.g. GitHub links, devlogs, demos, downloadable builds) as well as creative work like music and design experiments
* Support for varied aesthetics (I enjoy switching between pastel/minimalist, retro low-res UIs, and darker “hacker” aesthetics depending on the project)
* A way to categorize and tag projects flexibly: by tech stack, creative domain, or even emotional tone
* Blog or log-style sections for dev updates, experiments, or musings—ideally with a simple CMS or markdown-based system
* A section for DirektDSP as a standalone entity, where I can list products and potentially integrate a shop in future
* Performance and responsiveness are important—I care about good UX but also about the site feeling technically robust
* Bonus: subtle animations or interactions that add depth without clutter

### My Role in Development

I have experience in full-stack development and would be comfortable maintaining or even extending the site myself, so I’m open to solutions that are developer-friendly (e.g., built with React, Astro, SvelteKit, or other modern frameworks). That said, I’d appreciate collaboration on the initial UX/UI design, aesthetic cohesion, and overall structure.

Ideally, I’d like to work with someone who’s comfortable blending creative and technical priorities—someone who can help me think through how to best present a multi-dimensional identity without overwhelming the user.

### Goals

* Launch an initial version before the end of summer 2025
* Make the site flexible enough to evolve with me over the next few years
* Create something I’m proud to show to potential collaborators, employers, or clients
* Establish DirektDSP’s visual and brand identity alongside my own

If you think this aligns with your expertise, I’d love to discuss more and hear your thoughts. I’m happy to share wireframes, content drafts, or dive deeper into my current projects if that helps.

Thanks,
**Seamus Mullan**
