# DirektDSP

Professional audio software company demonstrating expertise in digital signal processing, plugin development, and music technology entrepreneurship

## Company Overview

DirektDSP is my main side project. It is an Audio software company built from the ground up solely by me.
Throughout the last 2 years of developing this company as a brand I've learned a countless amount of new skills and connected with people in the industry.
The end goal for this project is to provide a suite of audio plugins that professionals and beginner producers can use effectively for production. 

## The Audio Software Industry Challenge

Since the audio software industry is such a niche market, mainly filled up with larger companies with teams of developers and budgets larger than my total revenue to date, I needed to adapt and do as much myself as possible.
Doing this resulted in me learning Photoshop, JUCE, Figma, C++ and a bunch of DSP / maths to make these plugins. Ive also had to dabble with marketing and advertising.

### MakeItLoud - Easy to use Compressor + Distortion

MakeItLoud is the most recent plugin that I have released and it does one simple thing and it does it well. It makes things loud.

MakeItLoud is a sneaky combination of compressors and distortions that allows you to absolutely smash signals, make them extremely loud, and avoid clipping on your tracks. The plugin functions by routing the input audio between 2 compressors before and after distortion to ensure the volume is attenuated before it leaves the plugin.

### Fuzzboy - Analog-Modeled Distortion

Fuzzboy was the second plugin I ever made. I wanted to take what I had learned from books about audio processing (looking at you Will Pirkle) and implement them into a real plugin.
I took equations from the section on distortion (namely the asymmetric ones) and implemented them into a simple JUCE plugin. The GUI is made mostly with Photoshop, excluding the preset menu and sliders which are rendered using custom JUCE classes.

The plugin was a great learning experience and allowed me to apply the theory I had found in resources like books and videos. 

### Hot Potato - Custom Distortion Plugin
