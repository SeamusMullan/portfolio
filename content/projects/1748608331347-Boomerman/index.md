# Boomerman ðŸ’£

**A masterfully crafted Bomberman recreation demonstrating expertise in systems programming and high-performance game development**

## Project Overview

Boomerman showcases my **systems programming mastery** and deep understanding of low-level game development principles. Built entirely in C with Raylib, this project demonstrates my ability to work close to the hardware, optimize for performance, and create engaging interactive experiences without relying on high-level frameworks or engines.

## The Technical Challenge

Modern game development often abstracts away the fundamental systems that drive performance and user experience. By choosing to build Boomerman in C, I deliberately engaged with:

- **Memory Management**: Manual allocation and deallocation with zero garbage collection
- **Performance Optimization**: Direct control over every CPU cycle and memory access
- **Real-Time Systems**: Precise timing and responsive input handling
- **Graphics Programming**: Low-level rendering with immediate mode graphics
- **State Management**: Complex game state without object-oriented abstractions

## Technical Excellence in Systems Programming

### Core Architecture

**Game Engine Foundation**
```c
// Example of efficient game loop architecture
typedef struct {
    Player players[MAX_PLAYERS];
    Bomb bombs[MAX_BOMBS];
    PowerUp powerups[MAX_POWERUPS];
    Map game_map;
    GameState state;
    Timer game_timer;
} GameContext;

void UpdateGame(GameContext* ctx, float deltaTime) {
    UpdatePlayers(ctx->players, deltaTime);
    UpdateBombs(ctx->bombs, ctx->game_map, deltaTime);
    UpdateExplosions(ctx->explosions, deltaTime);
    CheckCollisions(ctx);
    UpdatePowerUps(ctx->powerups, deltaTime);
}
```

**Memory-Efficient Design**
- **Stack Allocation**: Minimal heap usage for predictable performance
- **Object Pooling**: Pre-allocated bomb and explosion pools preventing dynamic allocation
- **Struct-of-Arrays**: Cache-friendly data layout for batch processing
- **Memory Alignment**: Optimized data structures for CPU cache efficiency

### Real-Time Game Systems

**Precise Timing Control**
- **Fixed Timestep**: Consistent physics and game logic independent of framerate
- **Interpolation**: Smooth visual updates between logic frames
- **Input Buffering**: Responsive controls with minimal input lag

### Graphics Programming Mastery

**Efficient Rendering Pipeline**
```c
// Custom rendering system with batching
typedef struct {
    Texture2D texture;
    Rectangle source;
    Vector2 position;
    Color tint;
} SpriteRenderData;

void BatchRender(SpriteRenderData* sprites, int count) {
    // Sort by texture to minimize state changes
    qsort(sprites, count, sizeof(SpriteRenderData), CompareTextures);
    
    // Batch render calls for performance
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        DrawTextureRec(sprites[i].texture, sprites[i].source, 
                      sprites[i].position, sprites[i].tint);
    }
}
```
